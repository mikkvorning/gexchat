# Custom instructions for Copilot

## Project context

This project is a web chat application built with React, NextJS, Tailwind and Firebase.

## Indentation

We use tabs, not spaces.

## Coding style

Use camelCase for variable names and prefer arrow functions over traditional function expressions.
We generally don't like switch cases, so avoid unless it specifically offers a benefit that should not be ignored.

## MD-files

Do not create md unless it's strickly necessary. New changes and features to the application does not qualify for creation of MD-files.

## Auto-generated commit messages

Auto generated commit messages should be in past tense.
They should concise and descriptive, without including unnecessary and mundane details.
