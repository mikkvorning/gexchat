# Custom instructions for Copilot

## Project context

This project is a web chat application built with React, NextJS, Tailwind and Firebase

## Indentation

We use tabs, not spaces.

## Coding style

Use camelCase for variable names and prefer arrow functions over traditional function expressions.
We generally don't like switch cases, so avoid unless it specifically offers a benefit that should not be ignored
